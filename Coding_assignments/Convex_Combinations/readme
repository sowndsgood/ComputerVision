Convex Combination of vectors is the linear combination of points with the coefficients are non negative and they add to one.

- This is used in computer games to simulate 3D world to calculate the FOV(Field of View).

# Equation: 

x=λ1v1+⋯+λnvn, where λi≥0  and   λ1+⋯+λn=1(the coefficients sum is 1)
